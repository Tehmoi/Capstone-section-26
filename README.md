This is a personal blog site. It has the ability to create, delete, and edit posts. 
To activate, best to use nodemon index.js in terminal to trigger the serve
Once the server starts, open a browser and type http://localhost:3000 in the URL.
This will take you to the homescreen, where all active "Book" entries are. 
Each book is a file created using the 'Create Post' link in the footer.
Each link in the home page leads to a book, and on that books page, it can be edited. 
By maintaining the same title of the book, the entry can be edited.

more personal touches.
